# agentX

**agentX** is an implant or sensor designed to periodically check authorization status with an authentication server. It reduces network bandwidth usage while ensuring that only authorized devices can interact with protected systems. agentX acts as an efficient security solution for embedded devices, IoT systems, and other environments where maintaining a secure connection to an authentication server is critical which runs JAVA

## Features

- **Periodic Authorization Checks:** agentX periodically queries the authentication server to verify authorization status, ensuring ongoing security without continuous requests.
- **Network Bandwidth Optimization:** By minimizing the frequency of authorization checks and using lightweight communication protocols, agentX reduces the overall network traffic, making it ideal for bandwidth-constrained environments.
- **Clean and Maintainable Code:** Designed with simplicity and clarity, the agentX codebase is easy to maintain, extend, and integrate with other systems.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- A compatible authentication server that supports periodic authorization checks (e.g., OAuth2, JWT).
- A device or platform capable of running agentX (e.g., embedded system, IoT device).
- Network connectivity to communicate with the authentication server.

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/agentX.git
   cd agentX
   
2. **Try to compile to jar file**
```bash
    pray to intellij
    OR
    mvn package
    mvn clean package
```

3. **Import jar**
```bash
    use the jar file and import it as a dependancy
```

## Driver Code
put this your main function method

```java
    import org.agentX.agentXXX

    public static void main(String[] args){
         agentXXX agentX = new agentXXX();
         String args[1] = "your_api_key_here"; 
         boolean isAuthorized = agentX.callApi(apiKey);
         if (isAuthorized) {
            System.out.println("Authorization successful. Continuing execution...");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Authorization failed. Stopping execution.");
            System.exit(1); // Exit the program with an error code
        }

         //rest of program
   }


```
